# Air Pollution Service üå±
A simple Go service that provides a RESTful API for retrieving emission and air pollution data for 
all countries over the last 300 years. This microservice serves as a backend service that handles requests to 
fetch historical environmental data, including CO‚ÇÇ emissions, air pollutants, and other 
environmental factors, for every country around the globe. 

The required raw data can be downloaded here https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rejeph/air-pollution.

## üöÄ How to run

### Environment

| Name               | Default           | Route                                                                                  |
|--------------------|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| SERVER_PORT        | 8080              | Port used by the service.                                                              |
| AIR_POLLUTION_FILE | air-pollution.csv | Path to CSV file with [raw data](ttps://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rejeph/air-pollution). |

### Locally
 * Download the raw data to a file, e.g. `/data/air-pollution.csv`.
 * Point env variable `AIR_POLLUTION_FILE` to the file path. 
 * Run the service:
```bash
go run main.go
```

### Docker
* Download the raw data to a file, e.g. `/data/air-pollution.csv`.
```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/hbtgmbh/air-pollution-service:latest
docker run -v /data:/data -p 8080:8080 -e AIR_POLLUTION_FILE=/data/air-pollution.csv ghcr.io/hbtgmbh/air-pollution-service:latest
```

## üî® How to build

### Using Go
```bash
go build -o server
```

### Using Docker
```bash
docker build -t air-pollution-service .
```

### Using Make
```bash
make build
```

### Swagger API Documentation
For the Swagger API documentation, the project https://github.com/swaggo/swag is used. This generates the Swagger API documentation and integrates with a web framework (as such "Chi" used here) to render the Swagger Web UI at runtime.

The sources of this api-pollution-service come with an up-to-date generated Swagger documentation to facilitate easier Go compilation after checking out this project, as well as to make use of Git diffs between commits to review changes in the generated files.

To (re-)generate the Swagger API documentation, the `swag` CLI command must be installed:
```bash
go install github.com/swaggo/swag/cmd/swag@latest
```

After that, the documentation inside of the `docs/` directory can be (re-)generated by running:
```bash
swag init
```
