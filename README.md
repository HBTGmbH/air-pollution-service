# Air Pollution Service üå±
A simple Go service that provides a RESTful API for retrieving emission and air pollution data for 
all countries over the last 300 years. This microservice serves as a backend service that handles requests to 
fetch historical environmental data, including CO‚ÇÇ emissions, air pollutants, and other 
environmental factors, for every country around the globe. 

The required raw data can be downloaded here https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rejeph/air-pollution.
